## 📘 Project Description

This is a Windows Forms-based Pong game that features smooth paddle control, basic AI for the computer paddle, score tracking, and collision physics. The game logic is implemented using C# timers, `PictureBox` elements, and event-driven programming.

The ball bounces between the two paddles, and players score when the opponent fails to return the ball. The game includes a simple AI opponent and boundary constraints.

## ✨ Features

- 🎮 Player-controlled paddle (move using `Up` and `Down` keys)
- 🧠 AI-controlled opponent (follows the ball intelligently)
- 🧱 Ball bounces off paddles and top/bottom walls
